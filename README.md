# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project

## Private Space Launch Company Capstone Project

Welcome to the Private Space Launch Company Capstone Project repository!

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a data science capstone project focused on a private space launch company. In this project, I appllied data science techniques to analyze various aspects of the company's operations, ranging from data collection and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Project Goals

- Collect raw data from various sources relevant to the private space launch industry.
- Perform data wrangling to improve the quality and consistency of the collected data.
- Explore the processed data through EDA, SQL queries, statistical analysis, and data visualization to gain insights into the company's operations.
- Utilize advanced analytical techniques, such as predictive modeling, to uncover patterns and make informed decisions.
- Create a compelling presentation summarizing our findings and insights.
